# On Leadership by Jeff Weiner

It's important to understand the difference between **Managers** and **Leaders**. Managers tell people what to do. Leaders inspire them to do it.

The leadership is the ability to **inspire** others to achieve shared objectives. So it's essential for a leader to be able to inspire a team or an organization in order to achieve their objectives and mission.

To be an effective leader it's really important to be self aware, aware of others and aware of the environment.

When a leader is truly aware of the environment he is going to be inundated with a lot of information and needs to be really good at separating the signal from the noise. They should be really good at connecting dots, creating and developing plans and narratives and making good decisions.

The three pillars of effective leadership are

- Awareness
- Synthesis
- Inspiration

## Awareness

### Selfawarenes

Self-awareness is the ability to focus on yourself and how your actions, thoughts, or emotions do or don't align with your internal standards. If you're highly self-aware, you can objectively evaluate yourself, manage your emotions, align your behavior with your values, and understand correctly how others perceive you.

#### Be a spectator of your own thoughts

We tend to develop instincts that help us make fast decisions and be safe during our lives. Sometimes these instincts are not in our best interest and definitely are not in the best interest of the people we are working with.

Some of these behaviors can be egocentrism (very natural, help an individual make better decisions over time), triggers (past experience, trauma), biases (discrimination against people who are not like you).

To help fight human nature and be a spectator of your own thoughts is important to be in the moment and to be conscious of what's happening to you and what's happening around you. These skills can be developed through mindfulness practice (working out, breathing, meditation).

#### Manage compassionately

When speaking of the working environment, compassion is the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and see the world through their perspective for the sake of helping them.

Some of the benefits of managing in a compassionate way are:

- When you invest in the success of others, you're investing in your own success.
- Compassion leads to trust (consistency over time) and the trust leads to better decisions made faster.
- Proactively asking difficult questions to avoid unintended consequences.

The long-term value of a company is about the speed and quality of the decisions that are made within that company and amongst the decision-makers.

How should I compassionately manage the people I don't like or the people that underperform?

- Compassion is not conditional. It's the people that you don't naturally connect with the folks that need your compassion the most.
- Make difficult decisions compassionately. You should intervene when you spot underperformance and either coaching those persons, changing them to a different role or helping them transition out of the company in a constructive and compassionate way.

The most compassionate thing you can do is to be open, honest and constructive.

#### Know what you ultimately want to accomplish

## Synthesis

As an effective leader it's important to separate the signal from the noise and focus on the stuff that matters the most.

#### Vision to values

- Vision. The dream; A team's true north. The primary objective to the vision is to inspire and create a shared sense of purpose throughout the company.
- Mission. Overarching objective of the organization. Should be measurable, achievable, and ideally inspirational.
- Value Proposition. The benefit or advantage that the team promises to deliver to users/customers; the reason why they should use your product or service.
- Target audiences. The user/customer segments whose needs you prioritize. Understand who you're creating value for and don't assume it's for everybody.
- Strategy. How a company navigates its competitive landscape to achieve its objectives. Understand your competition. You're gonna beat the competition by being yourself and capitalizing on your company's strength.
- Priorities. Stack-ranked list of tactics designed to help the company realize its objectives.
- Objectives. Measurable goals align with realization of mission and strategy. If you can't measure it you can't fix it.
- Culture. The collective personality of the company, and perhaps more importantly, who you aspire to be.
- Values. The first principle that guides the organization's day-to-day decisions.

#### Linkedin

- Vision. Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.
- Mission. Connect the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful.
- Value Proposition. Company - Connect to opportunity, Members - Advance my career, Customers - Work smarter.
- Priorities. Talent (World class team), Technology, Trust, Member Experience, Customer Experience.
- Culture. Transformation Integrity Collaboration Humor Results.
- Values. Members First, Relationships Matter, be open, honest and constructive, Inspire Excellence, Take Intelligent Risks, Act like an Owner.

#### FoCuS

- Fewer things done better.
- Communicate the right info to the right people at right times. As organizations are rapidly growing they should be over communicating.
- Speed and quality of decision-making.

Decision-making -> RAPID

- Recommend. Recommends a decision or action
- Agree. Formally agrees to a recommendations - views must be reflected in final proposal
- Perform. Accountable for performing a decision once made
- Input. Provides input to a recommendation - views may or may not reflect in final proposal
- Decide. Makes the decision - commits the organization

#### Tools

Flying at the right altitude. Tactical vs Strategic. Problem-solving vs Coaching Time management. If you've scheduled every minute of every day you're not doing your job. You also need time to think. If you want to know someone's priorities focus less on their lists and more on how they spend their time. Take a look at your schedule and if it is not aligned with your priority list change either your schedule or your priority list.

## Inspiration

Leadership is the ability to **inspire** others to achieve shared objectives.
Managers vs Leaders. Managers tell people what to do. Leaders inspire them to do it.

If you want to inspire others, start with what inspires you.

Pillars of inspiration

- Clarity of your vision. What is your personal vision?
- Courage of your convictions. Believe in your vision with every fiber of your being. What are your personal values? Personal values card exercise. As a leader you want to make sure that your values are aligned with the team and the company.
- Effectively communicating both.
  - Authenticity. Align what you believe, what you feel, what you do and what you say. Striking the right balance of vulnerability.
  - Transparency. There is a virtuous cycle of transparency and a vicious cycle of obfuscation.
  - Repetition.

#### Effectively communicating

Three rules for effective public speaking:

- Know your audience.
- Know your material.
- Know your passion. When you are public speaking you need to do it in a passionate manner. When you are passionate about what you're talking about it's going to shine through.
