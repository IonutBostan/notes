# Get Started With OKRs

### OKRs basics

**Why OKRs?**
OKR can help surface the right priorities that a team should be focusing on and help point the team in that direction.

**What is an OKR?** An OKR has two parts, an objective and a set of key results. The objective is the "What?", the thing that a team is setting out to do in a determined period of time. The key results are the "How?" and it represents measurable benchmarks that show progress.

OKRs are a great vehicule for turning a company mission or purpose into action.

**What makes good OKRs?** OKRs represent the meaningful changes you want to see in your team and organization. They detail the criteria for success so a team understands if it needs to course correct or change action.

There are three qualities that make a good objective. An objective should be meaningful, audacious (courageous), inspiring.

A good set of key results are the three to five criteria that show you have accomplished an objective. They can be called milestones or benchmarks. The key results should have the following qualities:

- Specific and time-bound
- Aggressive yet realistic
- Measurable and verifiable

### Objectives

In order to set meaningful objectives, start by defining a time frame for your objectives. 90 days is the most used period when setting objectives and it allows you to adapt the objectives to the changes in your environment.

Start with a draft set of objectives and iterate over them. Ask yourself the following questions to get started:

- What are the most important things that we need to get done?
- What do we need to start doing or changing?
- What does success look like?

The ultimate goal when creating objectives is to come up with two or three objectives that matter the most and that answer the above questions.

To write really good objectives is important to understand why we are doing the work we are doing. And to better understand this a good exercise is to ask the following questions:

- Why does your organization or team exist?
- What inspires everyone to come to work everyday?
- What's your business model?
- Who are your customers?
- What expectations are there between manager and employee?
- Who are your competitors?

Answering the above questions help fill in the blanks: We are here to do `__________`. We are doing that because `_________`.

It's really important to be able to articulate to the team, the company revenue model, because this allows them to tie the way that sustains your organization with the purpose of the organization. This will allow the team to create good key results.

To better understand the organisation revenue model, try filling out the following sentence: We sustain ourselves by `________` in order to `_________`.

The OKRs don't need to incorporate every task in a team but what needs to be done differently or what needs to be changed in order to pursue the mission of the team. OKRs are not the same as your team's daily tasks.

The KPIs (Key performance indicators) need to be separate for the team OKRs. The important part about the OKRs is picking the KPIs that matter in the quarter ahead and track the changes that you're trying to accomplish.

An important step in setting the right objectives as a team is to request feedback from you teammates. Before asking for feedback try to think if the objective is following the three rules of an good objective:

- Is it meaningful?
- Is it audacious?
- Is it inspiring?

When asking for feedback on objectives you can use the following five questions to guide the feedback:

- Are you asking for an incremental change, a leap or a discovery?
- Can you make your Objective more specific?
- Can your Objective be more action-oriented?
- Can you say the same Objective in a more concise way?
- Can you make it more memorable?

There are various types of OKRs and each of these types defines what the finish line looks like for the team:

- Committed OKRs. The goals that must be met.
- Aspirational OKRs. Higher risk goals that push the team further.
- Learning OKRs. Exploration to prove a hypothesis.

When speaking about OKRs, it a good practice to align your team OKRs with the company or department OKRs. The alignment can be:

- Explicit Alignment. Inheriting another KR as your Objective.
- Directional Alignment. Using other OKRs as a guide for your own.

### Key Results

Key results are the measurable milestones that show progress. Normally each objective has three to five results and you can't have an objective without key results.

An excellent set of key results can help capture the progress and tell you when you have accomplish the objective. It should also gives you early warning signals along the way if you are not on track toward the objective that you've set.

The key results need to be time-bound, specific, measurable and verifiable. It's important to discuss these key results durring the weekly meetings as it gives a sense of the progress the team has achieved.

Normally the key results fall in one of these three categories:

- Inputs. The things you can control.
- Outputs. The things you produce.
- Outcomes. The changes you're trying to make.

It's a good practice to pair quantitative and qualitative key results as we want to ensure the quality of our objective and not just the quantity.

The key results can be categorized into leading indicators and lagging indicators.

**Leading indicators** are easier to measure in real-time, and are good for new or rapidly evolving products. Typically, developing sophisticated product analytics is the best way to keep an eye on these faster-moving metrics. It can be useful to set up a dashboard for your OKRs to watch them daily or weekly.

**Lagging indicators** are those tied most closely to the businessâ€™ success: things like revenue and bookings. Every product team should keep them in mind, but they usually manifest too slowly to be the only outcome you track. They make good long term goals, and are useful for mature products.

Another way to categories the key results is in the following categories:

- Incremental key results. A change from where you are today.
- Leap key results. A jump to a completely new state.
- Hold key results. Maintain where you are today.
